# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

The continuous control project works with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment. In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. The baseline of the code to solve the problem was provided by Udacity in their repository: https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git

### Environment 

 A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1. 

There are two versions of the environment, in the first version, one agent is used and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes. In the second version, the environment consists on 20 agents training in parallel, and to take into account the presence of many agents, the criteria to solve it is the following, the  agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).
The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. 
 
### Installation

1. Clone repository:

* git clone https://github.com/elifons/DeepRL-Continuous_Control.git
